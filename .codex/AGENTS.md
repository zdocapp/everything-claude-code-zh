# ECC for Codex CLI

This supplements the root `AGENTS.md` with Codex-specific guidance.

## Model Recommendations

|-----------|------------------|
| Routine coding, tests, formatting | o4-mini |
| Complex features, architecture | o3 |
| Debugging, refactoring | o4-mini |
| Security review | o3 |

## Skills Discovery

Skills are auto-loaded from `.agents/skills/`. Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` — Detailed instructions and workflow
- `agents/openai.yaml` — Codex interface metadata

Available skills:
- tdd-workflow — Test-driven development with 80%+ coverage
- security-review — Comprehensive security checklist
- coding-standards — Universal coding standards
- frontend-patterns — React/Next.js patterns
- frontend-slides — Viewport-safe HTML presentations and PPTX-to-web conversion
- article-writing — Long-form writing from notes and voice references
- content-engine — Platform-native social content and repurposing
- market-research — Source-attributed market and competitor research
- investor-materials — Decks, memos, models, and one-pagers

- backend-patterns — API design, database, caching
- e2e-testing — Playwright E2E tests
- eval-harness — Eval-driven development
- strategic-compact — Context management
- api-design — REST API design patterns
- verification-loop — Build, test, lint, typecheck, security

## MCP Servers

Configure in `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers]`. See `.codex/config.toml` for reference configuration with GitHub, Context7, Memory, and Sequential Thinking servers.

## Key Differences from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Hooks | 8+ event types | Not yet supported |
| Context file | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md only |
| Skills | Skills loaded via plugin | `.agents/skills/` directory |
| Commands | `/slash` commands | Instruction-based |
| Agents | Subagent Task tool | Single agent model |
| Security | Hook-based enforcement | Instruction + sandbox |
| MCP | Full support | Command-based only |

## Security Without Hooks

Since Codex lacks hooks, security enforcement is instruction-based:
1. Always validate inputs at system boundaries
2. Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
3. Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` before committing
4. Review `git diff` before every push
5. Use `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` in config

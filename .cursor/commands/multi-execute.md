# Execute - Multi-Model Collaborative Execution

Multi-model collaborative execution - Get prototype from plan → Claude refactors and implements → Multi-model audit and delivery.

## Usage

```bash
/execute <task description or plan file path>
```

> **Note**: This command requires Claude Code's multi-model orchestration infrastructure (codeagent-wrapper) which is not available in Cursor. Consider using Cursor's built-in agent mode for similar collaborative workflows.

# Plan - Multi-Model Collaborative Planning

Multi-model collaborative planning - Context retrieval + Dual-model analysis → Generate step-by-step implementation plan.

## Usage

```bash

> **Note**: This command requires Claude Code's multi-model orchestration infrastructure (codeagent-wrapper) which is not available in Cursor. Consider using Cursor's built-in agent mode for similar collaborative workflows.

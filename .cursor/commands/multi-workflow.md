# Workflow - Multi-Model Collaborative Development

Multi-model collaborative development workflow (Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review), with intelligent routing: Frontend → Gemini, Backend → Codex.

## Usage

```bash
/workflow <task description>
```

> **Note**: This command requires Claude Code's multi-model orchestration infrastructure (codeagent-wrapper) which is not available in Cursor. Consider using Cursor's built-in agent mode for similar collaborative workflows.

# Frontend - Frontend-Focused Development

Frontend-focused workflow (Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review), Gemini-led.

## Usage

```bash
/frontend <UI task description>
```

> **Note**: This command requires Claude Code's multi-model orchestration infrastructure (codeagent-wrapper) which is not available in Cursor. Consider using Cursor's built-in agent mode for similar collaborative workflows.

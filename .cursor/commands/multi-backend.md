# Backend - Backend-Focused Development

Backend-focused workflow (Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review), Codex-led.

## Usage

```bash
/backend <backend task description>
```

> **Note**: This command requires Claude Code's multi-model orchestration infrastructure (codeagent-wrapper) which is not available in Cursor. Consider using Cursor's built-in agent mode for similar collaborative workflows.
